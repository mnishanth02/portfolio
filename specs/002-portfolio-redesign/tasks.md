- Tasks T003, T004, T005 (verify shadcn components) can run in parallel

#### Within Foundational (Phase 2)
- Tasks T010, T011, T012, T013 (create data files) can run in parallel
- Tasks T016 can run in parallel with data file creation

#### Across User Stories (if team capacity allows)
Once Foundational phase completes, all 6 user stories can start in parallel by different developers:
- **Developer A**: User Story 1 (Timeline)
- **Developer B**: User Story 2 (Skills)
- **Developer C**: User Story 3 (Articles)
- **Developer D**: User Story 4 (Projects)
- **Developer E**: User Story 5 (Videos)
- **Developer F**: User Story 6 (Philosophy)

#### Within Individual User Stories
- **US1**: T018, T019 (populate data) run in parallel
- **US2**: T035, T036, T037, T038 (populate skills data) run in parallel
- **US4**: T082, T083, T084 (populate projects data) run in parallel

```bash
# Launch data population tasks together:
Task T018: "Populate career timeline data in lib/timeline-data.ts"
Task T019: "Populate running timeline data in lib/timeline-data.ts"

# Then sequentially (T020 blocks T021):
Task T020: "Create components/home/TimelineItem.tsx"
Task T021: "Implement TimelineItem visual structure"
```

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Checkpoints

Each user story has testing tasks embedded within the phase. Key checkpoints:

1. **After Each Component**: Verify component renders correctly in isolation
2. **After Integration**: Verify component works within homepage context
3. **After Responsive Implementation**: Test on 3 devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
4. **After Accessibility Implementation**: Test keyboard navigation and screen reader
5. **After Story Completion**: Run Lighthouse audit for that section

### Testing Tools Required

- **Performance**: Chrome DevTools Lighthouse, WebPageTest
- **Accessibility**: WAVE browser extension, axe DevTools, screen readers (VoiceOver/NVDA)
- **Responsive**: Chrome DevTools device mode, real devices (iPhone, iPad, Android)
- **Cross-browser**: BrowserStack or manual testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Code Quality**: Biome (already configured), TypeScript compiler

### Acceptance Criteria Validation

Each user story lists specific acceptance criteria from spec.md. Verify each criterion is met before marking story complete:

- **US1**: FR-001 through FR-009c, SC-002
- **US2**: FR-010 through FR-018b, SC-003
- **US3**: FR-024 through FR-033b, SC-004
- **US4**: FR-034 through FR-041a, SC-012
- **US5**: FR-042 through FR-049b
- **US6**: FR-019 through FR-023

### Final Validation (Before Production)

- [ ] All Lighthouse scores ‚â•95 (Performance), 100 (Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO)
- [ ] Core Web Vitals: LCP <1.0s, CLS <0.1, FID <100ms
- [ ] Total vertical scroll reduction: 3000-3800px (50-60% from baseline)
- [ ] Zero TypeScript errors: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- [ ] Zero Biome lint errors: `bun run lint`
- [ ] All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility verified (VoiceOver + NVDA)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing passed (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Mobile testing passed (iPhone, iPad, Android)
- [ ] Dark mode verified on all components

## Notes

### Component Architecture Decisions

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability (US1, US2, US3, US4, US5, US6)
- **RSC by default**: Timeline, Skills (grid), Articles (card), Projects (grid), Videos (card) are Server Components
- **Client when needed**: SkillTabs, ArticlesCarousel, VideoTabs use `'use client'` for interactivity
- **Composition pattern**: Wrapper RSCs fetch data and pass to client components (e.g., Skills ‚Üí SkillTabs)

### Data Strategy

- **Static data**: Timeline, skills, videos in `lib/*.ts` files
- **Build-time data**: Articles from MDX using content-collections (zero runtime overhead)
- **Image optimization**: All images via Next.js Image with blur placeholders, lazy loading
- **Type safety**: All data structures defined in `types/index.ts`, TypeScript strict mode

### Performance Targets

- **Bundle size**: <10% increase from baseline
- **LCP**: <1.0s (aggressive target, constitution allows <2.5s)
- **CLS**: <0.1 (no layout shifts during component loading)
- **FID**: <100ms (responsive interactions)
- **Lighthouse**: Performance ‚â•95, Accessibility 100

### Accessibility Requirements (WCAG AA)

- All interactive elements keyboard accessible (Tab, Arrow, Enter, Space, ESC)
- Focus indicators visible (2px ring minimum)
- Color contrast ‚â•4.5:1 for all text (light and dark modes)
- ARIA labels for all interactive widgets (carousels, tabs)
- Screen reader announcements for dynamic content
- Touch targets ‚â•44x44px on mobile

### Critical Success Metrics

1. **Vertical Scroll Reduction**: 3000-3800px (50-60%)
   - Timeline: 500-700px savings
   - Skills: 600-800px savings
   - Articles: 500-600px savings
   - Projects: 300-400px savings
   - Videos: 400-500px savings
   - Philosophy: 400-500px savings

2. **Performance Maintained**: Lighthouse ‚â•95 after all changes

3. **Accessibility Maintained**: WCAG AA compliance, 100% Lighthouse Accessibility

4. **User Experience**: Smooth interactions, responsive across all devices

## Summary

**Total Tasks**: 178 tasks
**Estimated Timeline**: 3-4 weeks (solo developer) | 2-3 weeks (team of 3)

### Task Distribution by User Story

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: 8 tasks
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: 9 tasks
- **User Story 1 - Timeline (P1)**: 17 tasks
- **User Story 2 - Skills (P1)**: 23 tasks
- **User Story 3 - Articles (P2)**: 24 tasks
- **User Story 4 - Projects (P2)**: 27 tasks
- **User Story 5 - Videos (P3)**: 26 tasks
- **User Story 6 - Philosophy (P3)**: 15 tasks
- **Polish & Cross-Cutting (Phase 9)**: 29 tasks

### Parallel Opportunities Identified

- **42 tasks** can run in parallel (marked with [P])
- **6 user stories** can be developed independently after Foundational phase
- **Within user stories**: Data population, component creation (child before parent)

### Independent Test Criteria

Each user story has clear independent test criteria:
- **US1**: Test dual timeline layout, keyboard navigation, screen reader
- **US2**: Test tab switching, keyboard navigation, responsive grid
- **US3**: Test carousel scrolling, touch gestures, arrow visibility
- **US4**: Test bento grid layout, hover effects, featured project prominence
- **US5**: Test video tabs, YouTube embed, responsive grid
- **US6**: Test /about page navigation, content display

### Suggested MVP Scope

**Recommendation**: User Stories 1 & 2 (both P1 priority)
- **Deliverables**: Dual timeline + Tabbed skills
- **Vertical Reduction**: ~1100-1500px (35-40% of target)
- **Value**: Showcases unique dual identity + efficient skill browsing
- **Timeline**: 2 weeks (solo) | 1 week (team)
- **Risk**: Low - both stories fully independent, well-defined requirements

### Format Validation

‚úÖ **ALL tasks follow checklist format**:
- Checkbox: `- [ ]` prefix ‚úÖ
- Task ID: Sequential (T001-T178) ‚úÖ
- [P] marker: Present only on parallelizable tasks ‚úÖ
- [Story] label: Present on all user story phase tasks (US1-US6) ‚úÖ
- Description: Clear action with file path ‚úÖ

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Complete Phase 1 (Setup) - verify all prerequisites
2. **Critical**: Complete Phase 2 (Foundational) - blocks all stories
3. **MVP Path**: Implement US1 + US2 ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí Gather feedback
4. **Full Feature**: Add US3 ‚Üí US4 ‚Üí US5 ‚Üí US6 incrementally
5. **Final**: Polish phase ‚Üí Production deployment
