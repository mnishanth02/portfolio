# Tasks: Portfolio Redesign - REFACTORING EXISTING IMPLEMENTATION

**Feature Branch**: `002-portfolio-redesign`
**Project Type**: **BROWNFIELD REFACTORING** - NOT greenfield development
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-portfolio-redesign/` + existing codebase analysis

**CRITICAL**: This replaces the original tasks.md which incorrectly assumed greenfield implementation. All tasks now focus on MODIFYING existing components.

## Format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Foundation - Fix Constitution Violations & Standardize Design Tokens

- [ ] R002 **[CRITICAL]** Extract mock project data from `Projects.tsx` to `lib/projects.ts` file
- [ ] R003 **[CRITICAL]** Add ARIA labels to all sections: Timeline, Skills, Projects, Videos, Blog (`aria-label` attributes)
- [ ] R004 [P] Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to `components/home/Timeline.tsx` with @param, @returns, @example
- [ ] R005 [P] Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to `components/home/Skills.tsx` with @param, @returns, @example
- [ ] R006 [P] Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to `components/home/Projects.tsx` with @param, @returns, @example

- [ ] R010 [P] Update Skills.tsx: Change spacing to `py-16` for section container
- [ ] R011 [P] Update Projects.tsx: Verify uses `py-16` (currently py-20 - FIX if needed)
- [ ] R012 [P] Update Videos.tsx: Change `py-20` to `py-16` for section spacing
- [ ] R013 [P] Update Blog.tsx: Change `py-20` to `py-16` for section spacing
- [ ] R014 [P] Update Timeline.tsx: Change h2 heading from `text-2xl font-bold` to `text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight`
- [ ] R015 [P] Update Skills.tsx: Change h3 heading from `text-2xl font-bold` to `text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight`
- [ ] R016 [P] Verify all h2 headings use `mb-8` for consistent margin-bottom
- [ ] R017 [P] Update all grid layouts to use `gap-6` consistently (Skills, Projects, Videos, Blog)
- [ ] R018 [P] Update Timeline icon sizes from `h-5 w-5` to `h-6 w-6` for better visibility
- [ ] R019 [P] Add container class to all sections: `<div className="container mx-auto max-w-7xl">`
- [ ] R020 Fix typo in Videos.tsx line 7: Change `ontainer` to `container`
- [ ] R021 [P] Standardize all hover effects to use `transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out`

**Checkpoint**: All components now follow consistent design system - safe to proceed with feature refactoring

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (Foundation)**: No dependencies - START HERE
- **Phase 2-6 (User Stories)**: All depend on Phase 1 completion
  - Can proceed in parallel IF multiple developers
  - Recommended sequential: US1 (P1) â†’ US2 (P1) â†’ US3 (P2) â†’ US4 (P2) â†’ US5 (P3) â†’ US6 (P3)
- **Phase 8 (Polish)**: Depends on all desired user stories complete

### Critical Path

1. **MUST COMPLETE FIRST**: R001-R003 (constitution violations)
2. **SHOULD COMPLETE EARLY**: R009-R021 (design token standardization)
3. **THEN PROCEED**: User story refactoring (R022-R094)
4. **FINAL**: Cross-cutting polish (R095-R122)

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within Phase 1**:
- R004-R008 (JSDoc comments) can run in parallel
- R009-R019 (design token updates) can run in parallel per component

**Across User Stories**:
With multiple developers, user stories can be tackled in parallel:
- Developer A: Timeline refactoring (US1)
- Developer B: Skills refactoring (US2)
- Developer C: Blogâ†’Articles refactoring (US3)

**Within Phase 8**:
- R095-R100 (consistency) can run in parallel
- R101-R106 (accessibility) can run in parallel
- R107-R111 (responsive testing) can run in parallel

4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test both features independently
5. Run Lighthouse, WAVE audits
6. Deploy to preview for feedback

**Expected Result**: ~1100-1500px vertical scroll reduction with core features

### Full Feature Implementation

**Week 2**: Important Features (P2)

4. Complete Phase 4: Blogâ†’Articles carousel refactoring
5. Complete Phase 5: Projects bento grid + server component
6. **VALIDATE**: Test all P1 + P2 features together

**Week 3**: Nice-to-Have + Polish (P3)

7. Complete Phase 6: Videos tabbed interface
8. Complete Phase 7: Philosophy relocation
9. Complete Phase 8: Cross-cutting polish
10. Final QA and production deployment

**Expected Result**: Full 3000-3800px vertical scroll reduction

## Key Differences from Original tasks.md

**Original tasks.md (INCORRECT)**:
- Assumed greenfield: "Create Timeline.tsx"
- Assumed greenfield: "Create Skills.tsx"
- Total: 178 tasks for NEW implementation

**This file (CORRECT)**:
- Brownfield reality: "Refactor Timeline.tsx"
- Brownfield reality: "Convert Skills to tabs"
- Total: 122 tasks for MODIFYING existing code

**Critical Fixes Added**:
- Constitution violation remediation (R001-R008)
- Design token standardization (R009-R021)
- Breaking change warnings for major refactors
- Explicit "remove/delete" tasks for refactoring

---

## Summary

**Total Refactoring Tasks**: 122 tasks
**Estimated Timeline**: 3-4 weeks (solo developer) | 2 weeks (team of 3)

### Task Distribution

- **Phase 1 (Foundation)**: 21 tasks - CRITICAL, blocks all feature work
- **Phase 2 (Timeline)**: 12 tasks
- **Phase 3 (Skills)**: 13 tasks
- **Phase 4 (Articles)**: 13 tasks
- **Phase 5 (Projects)**: 14 tasks
- **Phase 6 (Videos)**: 12 tasks
- **Phase 7 (Philosophy)**: 9 tasks
- **Phase 8 (Polish)**: 28 tasks

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Review this refactoring task list for accuracy
2. **Phase 1**: Fix constitution violations (R001-R003) - top priority
3. **Phase 1**: Standardize design tokens (R009-R021)
4. **Choose MVP or Full**: Implement US1+US2 for MVP OR all 6 user stories
5. **Final**: Polish phase â†’ Production deployment

**This refactoring task list accurately reflects the brownfield reality and is ready for execution! ðŸš€**
