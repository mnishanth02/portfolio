# Specification Quality Checklist: Portfolio Redesign - Vertical Scroll Reduction

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS

- Specification is written in plain language focused on user needs and business outcomes
- All sections describe "what" and "why" without prescribing "how"
- Accessible to non-technical stakeholders (product managers, designers, business analysts)
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions) completed

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ PASS

- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are explicit
- 60 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-060) are specific and testable
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (pixel reduction, Lighthouse scores, timing, percentages)
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (e.g., "Visitors can view complete dual timeline" not "React component renders two columns")
- 6 prioritized user stories with detailed acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format
- 10 edge cases identified covering data gaps, content overflow, accessibility, and responsive behavior
- Out of Scope section clearly defines 20 items not included in this feature
- Dependencies section lists all internal/external requirements

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ PASS

- Each of 60 functional requirements maps to user stories and success criteria
- User scenarios cover all 6 major features across 3 priority levels (P1, P2, P3)
- All success criteria are measurable without knowing implementation:
  - SC-001 to SC-005: Vertical scroll reduction (pixels)
  - SC-006 to SC-010: Performance (Lighthouse scores, Core Web Vitals)
  - SC-011 to SC-015: Accessibility (WCAG AA, keyboard, screen readers)
  - SC-016 to SC-020: User experience (timing, interaction quality)
  - SC-021 to SC-024: Responsive design (breakpoints, touch gestures)
  - SC-025 to SC-028: Content integrity (data preservation)
- No technical jargon or framework-specific details in specification body

**Overall Assessment**: ✅ **SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is comprehensive, unambiguous, and ready for the `/speckit.plan` phase. Developers can implement this specification without requiring additional clarification on requirements or scope.
