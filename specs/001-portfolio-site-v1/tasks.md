### Within Each User Story

**User Story 1 (P1)**:
- Hero, About, Projects, Contact sections can be built in parallel (marked [P])
- Home page assembly (T056) requires all sections complete
- Mobile responsiveness (T059-T062) requires all components complete
- SEO & performance (T063-T068) can happen after core components

**User Story 2 (P2)**:
- Blog hub, listing page, and individual posts can be built in parallel (marked [P])
- YouTube embeds can be built independently (marked [P])
- Sample content creation can happen in parallel (marked [P])

**User Story 3 (P2)**:
- Project detail pages can be built in parallel with technical blog content (marked [P])
- Enhanced modal requires ProjectCard from US1 to be complete

**User Story 4 (P3)**:
- Mobile performance optimization tasks can run in parallel (marked [P])
- Mobile testing requires all previous components to exist

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: Tasks T002-T010 (dependencies installation) can all run in parallel
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Tasks T027-T029 (Navigation, Footer, SocialLinks) can run in parallel
- **User Story 1**: Hero (T033-T036), About (T037-T041), Projects (T042-T048), Contact (T049-T055) sections can be built by different team members in parallel
- **User Story 2**: Blog hub (T069-T073), listing page (T074-T079), blog post pages (T080-T088), videos (T089-T092) can be built in parallel
- **User Story 3**: Project pages (T099-T105), enhanced modal (T106-T107), technical content (T108-T110) can be built in parallel
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Accessibility (T136-T143), content creation (T162-T170), documentation (T179-T181) can all run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (MVP)

```bash
# After Foundational Phase is complete, launch all US1 sections in parallel:

# Team Member 1: Hero Section
Task T033: "Create Hero section component in components/home/Hero.tsx"

Task T035: "Add social media quick links to Hero"
Task T036: "Implement CTA buttons in Hero"

# Team Member 2: About Section
Task T037: "Create About section component in components/home/About.tsx"

Task T041: "Display running achievements"

# Team Member 3: Projects Section
Task T042: "Create Projects section component"
Task T043: "Create ProjectCard component"
Task T044: "Add hover effects to ProjectCard"
Task T045: "Implement project modal preview"
Task T046: "Create project filtering logic"
Task T047: "Create project sorting logic"
Task T048: "Load project data from JSON files"

# Team Member 4: Contact Section
Task T049: "Create Contact section component"
Task T050: "Create ContactForm component with validation"
Task T051: "Add honeypot spam protection"
Task T052: "Create contact form API route"
Task T053: "Implement rate limiting in API route"
Task T054: "Add success/error message handling"
Task T055: "Add direct email and social links"

# Once all sections complete, proceed sequentially:
Task T056: "Assemble home page with all sections"
Task T057: "Implement smooth scrolling"
Task T058: "Add active section highlighting"
# ... continue with mobile responsiveness and SEO tasks
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only) - Recommended Path

1. **Week 1**: Complete Phase 1 (Setup) + Phase 2 (Foundational)
   - Foundation ready for user stories

2. **Week 2**: Complete Phase 3 (User Story 1 - Technical Recruiter)
   - Build Hero, About, Projects, Contact sections
   - Assemble single-page homepage
   - Optimize for mobile and performance
   - **STOP and VALIDATE**: Can recruiter evaluate candidate in 60 seconds?
   - Deploy MVP to production!

3. **Week 3**: Add Phase 4 (User Story 2 - Fitness Community)
   - Add blog content hub, listing page, individual posts
   - Add YouTube video embeds
   - **Test independently**: Can fitness enthusiast find content in 3 minutes?
   - Deploy to production

4. **Week 4**: Add Phase 5 (User Story 3 - Collaborator)
   - Add detailed project case study pages
   - Enhance blog with technical content
   - **Test independently**: Can collaborator assess expertise in 10-15 minutes?
   - Deploy to production

5. **Week 5**: Add Phase 6 (User Story 4 - Mobile Optimization)
   - Mobile performance tuning across all features
   - **Test independently**: Can mobile user complete any journey?
   - Deploy to production

6. **Week 6**: Complete Phase 7 (Polish)
   - Final accessibility, SEO, content quality improvements
   - Cross-browser testing and bug fixes
   - Launch!

### Incremental Delivery

Each user story adds value without breaking previous stories:
- **After US1**: Have working portfolio for recruiters (MVP!)
- **After US2**: Add fitness community content (differentiation!)
- **After US3**: Add detailed project case studies (depth!)
- **After US4**: Ensure mobile experience (reach!)
- **After Polish**: Production-ready portfolio (launch!)

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 3-4 developers after Foundational phase completes:
- **Developer 1**: User Story 1 (Hero, About - T033-T041)
- **Developer 2**: User Story 1 (Projects - T042-T048)
- **Developer 3**: User Story 1 (Contact - T049-T055)
- **Developer 4**: User Story 2 (Blog - T069-T088) can start in parallel

All user stories integrate independently and can be deployed incrementally.

## Estimated Task Count by Phase

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 18 tasks
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 14 tasks
- **Phase 3 (User Story 1 - MVP)**: 36 tasks (T033-T068)
- **Phase 4 (User Story 2)**: 30 tasks (T069-T098)
- **Phase 5 (User Story 3)**: 17 tasks (T099-T115)
- **Phase 6 (User Story 4)**: 20 tasks (T116-T135)
- **Phase 7 (Polish)**: 68 tasks (T136-T203)

**Total**: 203 tasks

**MVP Scope** (Recommended): Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 = **68 tasks** for fully functional recruiter-focused portfolio

**Parallel Opportunities**: ~60% of tasks marked [P] can run in parallel with proper team coordination

---

## Notes

- **[P] marker**: Tasks marked [P] work on different files and have no dependencies, enabling parallel execution
- **[Story] label**: Every user story task has [US1], [US2], [US3], or [US4] label for traceability
- **File paths**: All tasks include specific file paths for immediate implementation
- **Independent testing**: Each user story has clear independent test criteria
- **MVP focus**: User Story 1 (P1) is the recommended MVP - delivers core portfolio functionality
- **Incremental delivery**: Each user story can be deployed independently without breaking previous functionality
- **Constitution compliance**: All tasks align with project constitution (zero-database, performance targets, accessibility standards)
