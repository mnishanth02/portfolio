# Clarifications Resolved - Portfolio Website Specification

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Branch**: `001-portfolio-site-v1`
**Status**: âœ… READY FOR PLANNING PHASE

---

## Summary of Decisions

All three critical clarification questions have been resolved with explicit implementation guidance.

### Decision 1: Contact Form Backend Service âœ…

**Choice**: Option A - **Resend** with honeypot spam protection

**Key Details**:
- **Provider**: Resend (https://resend.com)
- **Free Tier**: 5,000 emails/month
- **Cost**: Free tier sufficient for personal portfolio
- **Spam Protection**: Honeypot technique (hidden `website` field)
- **Rate Limiting**: IP-based (1 submission per minute)

**Implementation Specs**:
- API Route: `app/api/contact/route.ts`
- SDK: Resend TypeScript client
- Environment: `NEXT_PUBLIC_RESEND_API_KEY` (Vercel secrets)
- Error Handling: Graceful fallback to `mailto:` link if Resend fails
- Response: 200 status with success message, email notification to owner

**Why Resend**:
- Modern, developer-friendly API
- Excellent Next.js documentation
- Generous free tier eliminates cost concerns
- Minimal setup (no complex configurations)
- Honeypot sufficient for low-volume contact form (5-10 submissions/month estimated)

### Decision 2: Analytics Solution âœ…

**Choice**: Custom - **PostHog** (open-source product analytics)

**Key Details**:
- **Provider**: PostHog (https://posthog.com)
- **Free Tier**: 1,000,000 events/month
- **Cost**: Free tier sufficient for portfolio analytics needs
- **Privacy Model**: Privacy-first with optional self-hosting
- **Tracking**: Anonymous session IDs only (no PII collected)

**Implementation Specs**:
- SDK: `@posthog/next` for Next.js App Router
- Initialization: Provider wrapper in `app/layout.tsx`
- Storage: SessionStorage (no cookies required)
- Data Minimization: Session ID, event type, timestamp, URL only
- Events to Track:
  - Page views (hero, about, projects, blog, contact)
  - Section scrolls (engagement depth)
  - Project card clicks and views
  - Blog post reads (scroll completion)
  - Video plays (YouTube embeds)
  - Contact form submissions
  - Social media link clicks

**Configuration**:
- Environment: `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST`
- Disable IP geolocation if privacy concern
- Use anonymized session IDs only
- Dashboard: Real-time analytics at posthog.com

**Why PostHog**:
- Aligns with Constitution privacy-first principle
- Strong Next.js SDK support for App Router
- Generous free tier (1M events/month)
- Open-source core provides transparency
- Optional self-hosting for maximum privacy control
- Rich analytics features: events, funnels, cohorts, recordings (optional)
- No competitor to privacy principles (vs GA4)
- Better than Vercel Analytics for custom event tracking (needed for fitness/tech content tracking)

### Decision 3: Project Showcase Architecture âœ…

**Choice**: Option C - **Hybrid Approach** (modal preview + dedicated pages)

**Architecture**:
```
Portfolio Homepage (Single-page SPA)
  â”œâ”€â”€ Project Cards (in grid)
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Click â†’ Modal Opens
  â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Preview: thumbnail, title, excerpt, tech stack
  â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ "Learn More" button â†’ Navigate to project page
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Project Modal (client-side)
  â”‚
  â””â”€â”€ Dedicated Project Pages (Server-side)
      â”œâ”€â”€ Route: /projects/[slug]
      â”œâ”€â”€ SSG: generateStaticParams for all projects
      â””â”€â”€ Full Case Study
          â”œâ”€â”€ Problem statement
          â”œâ”€â”€ Technical approach
          â”œâ”€â”€ Architecture decisions
          â”œâ”€â”€ Challenges & solutions
          â”œâ”€â”€ Metrics & outcomes
          â”œâ”€â”€ Related projects
          â””â”€â”€ Back to portfolio link

```

**Implementation Details**:
- **Modal Component**: Client Component (`"use client"`)
  - Opens on project card click
  - Contains basic project info + "Learn More" button
  - Smooth close/back navigation

- **Project Pages**: Server Components by default
  - Route: `app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx`
  - Dynamic route with `generateStaticParams`
  - Full SSG at build time
  - Includes detailed case study content

- **Navigation Flow**:
  - Hero â†’ Projects section
  - Click project card â†’ Modal preview
  - Click "Learn More" â†’ Route to `/projects/project-slug`
  - Back button/link returns to projects section on home page

- **SEO & Shareability**:
  - Each project page has unique meta tags
  - OpenGraph image (project thumbnail)
  - Twitter Card metadata
  - Canonical URL per project
  - Sitemap includes all project URLs

- **Content Structure**:
  - Projects stored as: `content/projects/project-name.mdx`
  - Frontmatter with: title, slug, description, image, techStack, liveUrl, githubUrl, featured
  - Zod validation for frontmatter schema

**Why Hybrid Approach**:
- **P1 (Recruiters)**: Fast modal preview fits 30-60 second scan
- **P2 (Fitness)**: Can skip detailed project pages, focus on blog/about
- **P3 (Collaborators)**: Access comprehensive case studies on dedicated pages
- **SEO Benefits**: Each project URL indexable, shareable on LinkedIn/Twitter
- **Performance**: Modal = instant interaction, pages = pre-rendered SSG
- **User Choice**: Browse quickly (modal) OR read deeply (dedicated pages)
- **Optimal Balance**: Fast interaction paths for quick browsers + detailed content for serious evaluators

**Related Features Enabled**:
- Project filtering by technology
- Project sorting (recent, alphabetical, type)
- "Related Projects" suggestions on project pages
- Project search/discovery (future iteration)
