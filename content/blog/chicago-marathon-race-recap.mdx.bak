## Race Details

- **Event**: 2024 Chicago Marathon
- **Date**: October 13, 2024
- **Goal**: Boston Qualifier (3:20:00 for M30-34)
- **Result**: 3:15:42 (4:18 under BQ standard!)
- **Place**: 1,847th overall, 412th in age group

## Training Block

I followed a 16-week modified Pfitzinger 18/55 plan with these key elements:

- **Peak Mileage**: 62 miles (Week 12)
- **Long Runs**: Peaked at 22 miles
- **Key Workouts**:
  - Tuesday: Tempo runs (8-10 miles at marathon pace +15s)
  - Thursday: Speed intervals (12x400m, 8x800m, 4x1600m)
  - Sunday: Long runs with progressive pace
- **Recovery**: Full rest Monday, easy 4-6 miles Wednesday/Friday

**No injuries**, which was the real victory. Slowing down easy runs made all the difference.

## Pre-Race Strategy

After analyzing my training data, I settled on this race plan:

### Pace Strategy (Negative Split)

```
Miles 1-3:   7:40/mile (warm up into race)
Miles 4-13:  7:30/mile (find rhythm)
Miles 14-20: 7:25/mile (push gently)
Miles 21-26: 7:15-7:00/mile (empty the tank)
```

**Goal**: Run 1:38:30 first half, 1:37:00 second half

### Nutrition Plan

- Pre-race: Bagel with peanut butter (3 hours before)
- During race:
  - Maurten Gel 100 at miles 6, 12, 18, 23
  - Water at every aid station
  - Gatorade at miles 10, 15, 20

### Mental Cues

I memorized these mantras for different phases:

- **Miles 1-13**: "Earn your finish in the first half"
- **Miles 14-20**: "This is where the race begins"
- **Miles 21-26**: "You trained for this, trust the process"

## Race Day Execution

### Miles 1-6: The Start (7:34/mile avg)

Chicago starts with 45,000+ runners. The first 3 miles are about dodging people and staying patient. I fought every urge to go with the packs surging past me.

**Actual paces**: 7:42, 7:38, 7:35, 7:32, 7:30, 7:30

Goal was 7:40 for first 3 miles, so I was right on track.

### Miles 7-13: Finding My Rhythm (7:29/mile avg)

This is where the race settled. I found a pack running perfect pace and tucked in.

**Actual paces**: 7:28, 7:30, 7:29, 7:28, 7:31, 7:29, 7:27

First half: **1:38:28** (2 seconds faster than goal!)

### Miles 14-20: The Mental Game (7:23/mile avg)

This is where I started to feel it. Legs getting heavy. But I remembered: "This is where the race begins."

I passed Strava segment after Strava segment, ticking off familiar landmarks from training runs.

**Actual paces**: 7:25, 7:24, 7:22, 7:23, 7:20, 7:25, 7:22

Still on pace for sub-3:15!

### Miles 21-26.2: Suffering Into Glory (7:11/mile avg)

Mile 21 was when the bonk demons arrived. But unlike my first marathon, I was ready. I took my final gel, doused myself with water, and went to work.

**Actual paces**: 7:18, 7:15, 7:10, 7:08, 7:05, 7:02, 6:48 (final 0.2)

The final mile was pure adrenaline. I saw my family at mile 25.5 and just started sprinting. Everything hurt, but I was going to crush this BQ.

## The Finish

As I crossed the finish line in **3:15:42**, I couldn't believe it. I had:

- ✅ Qualified for Boston by 4:18
- ✅ Ran negative splits (1:38:28 / 1:37:14)
- ✅ Felt strong through mile 26
- ✅ Executed the race plan perfectly

## What Went Right

### 1. Conservative Start

Starting at 7:40 pace felt embarrassingly slow. But it meant I had gas in the tank when it mattered.

### 2. Training Paid Off

Every tempo run, every interval session, every long run showed up when I needed it. The hay was in the barn.

### 3. Nutrition Timing

Taking gels at exactly miles 6, 12, 18, 23 meant I never bonked. Every gel was 25 minutes of energy.

### 4. Mental Preparation

I knew miles 20-23 would hurt. I visualized them hundreds of times in training. When they arrived, I was ready.

## What Went Wrong

### 1. Started Slightly Fast

Miles 4-6 should have been 7:35, not 7:30. I gave back some time in miles 18-20 as a result.

### 2. Gel at Mile 23 Too Late

Should have taken the final gel at mile 21. Would have had more energy for the final 5K.

### 3. Didn't Use Pace Group

I passed the 3:15 pace group at mile 8 and never looked back. In retrospect, staying with them would have been mentally easier.

## Data Breakdown

**Heart Rate:**

- Average: 168 bpm (85% max)
- Miles 1-13: 162 bpm
- Miles 14-20: 170 bpm
- Miles 21-26: 178 bpm

**Cadence:**

- Average: 178 spm
- Consistent throughout (good!)

**Power (Stryd):**

- Average: 245W
- Clear upward trend in final 10K (went anaerobic)

## Lessons for Next Time

1. **Take final gel at mile 21**, not 23
2. **Start even slower** (7:45 pace for first 5K)
3. **Use pace group** through mile 20 for mental support
4. **More 20-22 mile runs** in training (I peaked at 22 once)

## What's Next?

With a BQ time in hand, my goals for 2025:

- **Boston 2025**: Run the race (goal time: 3:10)
- **Chicago 2025**: Try for 3:05
- **Half Marathon**: Sub-1:30 (current PR: 1:32:18)

## Final Thoughts

Chicago is an incredible race. Fast, flat course. Amazing crowd support. Perfect October weather. If you're chasing a BQ, this is your race.

But more than the time, I'm proud of the journey:

- 16 weeks of disciplined training
- No injuries
- Executed the race plan
- Learned to respect the distance

**The marathon teaches you that discipline, patience, and systematic progression beat talent and luck every time.**

Now, time to start planning for Boston. The real work begins.
